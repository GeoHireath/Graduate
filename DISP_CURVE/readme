disp_curve calculates dispersions between stations for ambient noise correlation
disp_curve_eq calculates dispersions between events and stations

need int_CUB2_R_* models
INPUT_MODEL include model file names and period
period contains the period you wish to calculate
station.lst contains station name and location.

For disp_curve_eq, you also need to prepare event.lst for event locations.
