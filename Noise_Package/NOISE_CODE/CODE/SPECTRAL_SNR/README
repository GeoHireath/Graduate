lin_rms
   Inside this directory,  spectral_snr_f calculate  the SNR using minV and 
   maxV obtained from pred*_R at the shortest perid and the longtest period
   ( forexample, 5 and 100) 
   ,which is read from SAC headfile user4 and user5. 
   Thus, this version requires the prior parameter user4 user5 in each head 
   of SAC file. 

  spectral_snr_f_V2 calculate  the SNR using minV and 
   maxV of 1 and 4. 
  
  The problem with these version is  time window calculated uisng minT and 
   maxT is too long. This time window may include precursory signals. 


yang_lin_rms
   spectral_snr_f calculate  the SNR using minV and 
   maxV obtained from pred*_R at the short    perid and     longt    period
   of each small frequency band instead of the whole band in lin_rms.
  Thus this version can more accurately calculate the time window of signals.


### To make, just run:
### gfortran -o find_rms_per_v2 find_rms_per_v2.f
